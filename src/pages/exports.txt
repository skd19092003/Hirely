1. Import as a named export
export const ApplyJobDrawer = ({ user, job, applied = false, fetchJob }) => { ... }
import it as
ex: import { ApplyJobDrawer } from "@/components/ui/apply-job";

2. Or, export as default (not recommended if you have/want multiple exports)
If you want to keep the default import, change the export in apply-job.jsx to:
ex= const ApplyJobDrawer = ({ user, job, applied = false, fetchJob }) => { ... }
export default ApplyJobDrawer;

Use curly braces for named exports: import { ApplyJobDrawer } .................
Use no curly braces for default exports: import ApplyJobDrawer ...............

if multiple exports then always use namedexports......................
